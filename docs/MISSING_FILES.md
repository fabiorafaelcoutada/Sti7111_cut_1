# Missing Documentation

The following files were referenced in the project context but were not found in the repository:

1.  **Microprocessor Datasheets**: PDF files detailing the specifications of the microprocessor running on the development board.
2.  **Reference Manuals**: PDF manuals for the development board and its peripherals.
3.  **Markdown Index**: A specific index file that was supposed to accompany the PDFs.
4.  **C# Source Code**: The `Crypto Calculator` project contains a `.csproj` file but the corresponding `.cs` source files (`Cripto.cs`, `Program.cs`) are missing.

If these files are located, please place them in the `docs/` directory or update this repository structure accordingly.
